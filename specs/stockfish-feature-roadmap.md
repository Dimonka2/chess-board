## Risk Management

### High Risks
1. **Stockfish API Rate Limiting**
   - Mitigation: Implement aggressive caching, add retry logic
   - Fallback: Disable feature gracefully if API unavailable

2. **Browser localStorage Limitations**
   - Mitigation: Handle quota exceeded errors, implement cache pruning
   - Fallback: Work without cache, just slower

3. **Performance Impact**
   - Mitigation: Lazy load Stockfish code, optimize bundle size
   - Fallback: Make feature optional (default disabled)

### Medium Risks
1. **CORS Issues with Stockfish API**
   - Mitigation: Test early, work with API provider if needed
   - Fallback: Provide proxy option or self-hosted alternative

2. **File Size Bloat**
   - Mitigation: Code splitting, tree shaking, minification
   - Fallback: Separate build for Stockfish-enabled version
   - Note: Alternative solutions and i18n will add ~3-5KB

3. **Complex Alternative Solution Patterns**
   - Mitigation: Document limitations, provide clear examples
   - Fallback: Support simple pipe-separated format only

### Low Risks
1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Test early and often on all major browsers
   - Fallback: Feature detection and graceful degradation
